## Project Description
Farmers who grow potatoes are facing drastic economic losses every year due to the various disease that can happen to a potato plant. There are two common diseases, which are known as **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**. Early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism. If a farmer can detect the cause of the disease in an early stage and apply appropriate treatment, it can save waste and prevent economic loss tremendously.

AtliQ Agriculture is an AI company that focus on solving problems in agriculture domain. The company has takne this project and decided to build a mobile application which they can give it to farmers. For farmers, all they need to do is to take a photo of the plant and the mobile application will tell them whether the plans is healthy or it has one of the diseases.

## Project Goal
Our goal is to buld the model that supports the "behind the scene" of the mobile application, which uses **deep learning** and **conbolutional neural network**.

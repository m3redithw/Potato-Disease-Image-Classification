# Potato Disease Classification

Farmers who grow potatoes are facing drastic economic losses every year due to the various disease that can happen to a potato plant. There are two common diseases, which are known as **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**. Early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism. If a farmer can detect the cause of the disease in an early stage and apply appropriate treatment, it can save waste and prevent economic loss tremendously.
